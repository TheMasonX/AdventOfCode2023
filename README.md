# AdventOfCode2023

I was inspired by [Low Level Learning's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGJPLh7O2iI) to use the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) to get more familiar with [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html). Feel free to use any of this code, though I can't guarentee the quality since I'm learning haha. To that extent though, I'd be very grateful for any feedback! Thank you and I wish you happy holdiays!
